		<h1>Welcome to WhiteBored! </h1>
		<h3>A place where you can share your Boredom with the world</h3>

		<h2>About WhiteBored</h2>
		<p>WhiteBored is a simulation of the communal whiteboards that you pass by in hallways or in lounges, on which people can draw or write something to leave for others to see and perhaps respond to and build upon. It is not meant to be a super fancy drawing app -- many of those already exist. Thus (for now), you are supplied with 7 marker colors and an eraser, each with a fixed size. But the creativity you supply for yourself is endless!</p>

		<h2>What's Next</h2>
		<p>As you might have discovered, the "Share a Link!" magnet is not working yet. Hopefully soon, I will figure out how to implement the functionality of storing unique WhiteBoreds with a unique URL for you to share with your friends. I am also trying to figure out how to allow real-time collaboration on a WhiteBored so that multiple people can draw on a Bored simultaneously and see the changes in real-time. Exciting ambitions! (Though I must remember to remain patient.)</p>
